          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
            2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

          <h3>Short Story</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
                There was a boatman in our Rameshwarm he 
                Had a loving wife to look after the house 
                They have a 5 kids it was a poor family but 
                Somehow he educated his kids.
                They starved and fed their children.
                There was some magic in the simple gruel or 
                Porridge served by the mother.
                The last son was very studious.
                He came first in his class.
                He studied engineering in Madras institute of technology Then he became a scientist in ISRO
                He was called THE MISSILE MAN.
                Recently he is the one who conducted the Nuclear test in pokhran.
                Do you know is name ?
                A.p .J Abdul Kalam.
                If that boatman had thought
                Why should my son study?
                If he came with me to this job,i could make a few extra trips and earn extra pennies.
                Then our country would have lost a brilliant  scientist,who is also the pride of our nation?
